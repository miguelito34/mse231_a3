Trump	2016-08-07T23:09:08Z	Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
Trump	2016-08-07T21:31:46Z	"The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, ""the baby"" and so much more. Very dishonest!"
Trump	2016-08-07T13:49:29Z	I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!

Trump	2016-08-01T13:03:02Z	So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
Trump	2016-08-01T12:50:32Z	"When I said in an interview that Putin is ""not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down,"" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!"
Trump	2016-08-01T11:27:43Z	This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
Trump	2016-08-01T11:10:51Z	Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

Trump	2016-07-25T21:57:14Z	I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
Trump	2016-07-25T21:45:54Z	Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
Staff	2016-07-25T21:33:49Z	While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Staff	2016-07-25T21:32:59Z	Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Trump	2016-07-25T14:01:25Z	The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Trump	2016-07-25T13:42:55Z	Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
Trump	2016-07-24T22:16:59Z	The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
Trump	2016-07-24T22:07:49Z	Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
Trump	2016-07-24T20:45:31Z	The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
Trump	2016-07-24T20:30:06Z	I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
Trump	2016-07-24T13:30:59Z	Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
Trump	2016-07-24T13:27:56Z	"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!"
Trump	2016-07-24T12:30:15Z	An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Trump	2016-07-24T12:15:51Z	Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
Trump	2016-07-24T11:56:43Z	Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Trump	2016-07-24T11:25:06Z	Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
Trump	2016-07-24T11:16:15Z	The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Trump	2016-07-23T20:43:33Z	Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
Trump	2016-07-23T16:06:15Z	I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Trump	2016-07-23T15:36:41Z	Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Trump	2016-07-23T15:01:48Z	Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Trump	2016-07-23T14:51:32Z	Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Trump	2016-07-23T10:55:20Z	Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
Trump	2016-07-23T10:42:10Z	Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
Trump	2016-07-23T10:35:37Z	Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
Trump	2016-07-23T10:31:18Z	The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?

Trump	2016-07-23T03:49:04Z	I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.

Trump	2016-04-01T04:23:25Z	The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!

Trump	2016-02-10T13:37:25Z	Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
Staff	2016-02-10T13:00:20Z	Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred!
Staff	2016-02-10T12:59:43Z	Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

Trump	2016-02-09T22:19:31Z	We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security.
Trump	2016-02-09T22:15:34Z	We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!
Trump	2016-02-09T21:40:19Z	"ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our ""leader"" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results"

Trump	2016-02-09T13:32:26Z	I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. A.M. Enjoy!
Trump	2016-02-09T12:23:37Z	The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great!
Trump	2016-02-09T12:16:37Z	No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
Trump	2016-02-09T12:08:19Z	"I know the ""Governors"" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!"
Trump	2016-02-09T12:00:30Z	"Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (""come as act of love""). Not a leader!"

Staff	2016-02-03T20:22:46Z	Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
Staff	2016-02-03T19:25:08Z	The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
Trump	2016-02-03T19:09:38Z	I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
Trump	2016-02-03T14:28:59Z	Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
Trump	2016-02-03T14:21:03Z	"And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and ""choice"" - a total lie!"
Trump	2016-02-03T14:07:25Z	Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
Trump	2016-02-03T13:56:48Z	During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Trump	2016-02-03T13:47:33Z	Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
Trump	2016-02-03T05:12:23Z	Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN

Staff	2016-01-23T02:08:41Z	Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.
Staff	2016-01-23T02:04:23Z	Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
Staff	2016-01-23T01:34:26Z	Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
Staff	2016-01-23T01:33:17Z	The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
